We are working on a weather app and API that will provide users with up-to-date weather forecasts and alerts. Our app will be easy to use, and our API will get location data from set location, and not use gps or ip tracking and logging to get weather data.

## Features and Concepts
Data Sources: Choose reliable and open data sources for your weather information, such as the OpenWeatherMap API, National Weather Service API, or other similar services.

Location Input: Allow users to input their location manually or select it from a list of pre-defined locations. This approach ensures that you're not relying on GPS or IP tracking to obtain weather data for a particular area.

User Interface: Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the app that displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather forecast for the next few days. Optionally, you can include a simple map showing weather patterns.

Weather Alerts: Implement a notification system that alerts users of severe weather conditions, such as storms, tornadoes, or heatwaves, based on their set location.

API Design: Create a simple and well-documented API that allows developers to access your weather data easily. Make sure to include authentication and rate limiting features to protect your service from abuse.

Privacy Policy: Draft a clear privacy policy outlining the project's commitment to user privacy and explaining how we handle user data.

Localization: Support multiple languages and adapt to various regions to make your app accessible to as many users as possible.
